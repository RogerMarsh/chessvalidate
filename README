Results validation for chess games
==================================

.. contents::


Description
===========

Prepare validation reports on results of chess games from events such as tournaments and leagues.

Results can be typed in; or extracted from emails or their text, csv, pdf, odt, docx, or spreadsheet attachments.

League fixture lists are used to point out missing or surplus match reports.  Duplicate consistent match reports are treated as a single match report. 


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is not available on PyPI, or any other package index, but can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user --trusted-host solentware.co.uk --find-links http://solentware.co.uk/wheels.html chessvalidate

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.

Then run 'python -m pip check' to identify other packages which need to be installed.

The following should be installed to support extraction of results from pdf and spreadsheet attachments.

* `Xpdf`_, specifically the `pdftotext`_ utility to handle pdf.
* `Gnumeric`_, specifically the ssconvert utility in the `download`_ to handle spreadsheets.

Sometimes it is possible to use `pdfminer3k`_ instead of pdftotext; and `xlsx2csv`_ instead of ssconvert.

Open Document Format (ods) and Office Open XML (xlsx) attachments can be handled without Gnumeric or xlsx2csv.

Open Document Format (odt) and Open Office XML (docx) attachments can be handled without an 'office' application such as Microsoft Office.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m chessvalidate.validate

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m chessvalidate.validate

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python -m chessvalidate.validate

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m chessvalidate.validate

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting results_report.


Restrictions
============

At time of writing, March 2022, `Gnumeric`_ do not provide installers for Microsoft Windows.  According to the website, provision ceased in August 2014.


Notes
=====

The chessvalidate package supports the collection and validation of game results by event.  It provides data collection for the chesstabular, chessresults and chesssubmit packages.

It is difficult to stray far from the style:

28 January 2015 J Smith 1 0 P Jones

when typing results one per line, or row in csv and spreadsheets, with

J Smith 1 P Jones 0 28 January 2015

and similar not straying too far.  Otherwise you may have to figure some regular expressions to put in the configuration file for the event: avoid having to do this if at all possible.

If the csv or spreadsheet file splits the components of a result into columns you will have to say how to stitch the columns together in the configuration file.
