Documents Menu

Open, close, and edit, documents.

Validate documents and apply the results to a database if one is open.

Documents can be edited to make corrections to all details: games, player names, and so forth.  The corrections are made to the database by re-applying the document to the database.

The Take On menu item handles results prepared by the prepare_ecf_format and prepare_league_format programs.  It is a specialized Open.

Alt + d | o		Open an existing, or create a new, document.
Alt + d | t		Open an existing, or create a new, take-on document.
Alt + d | c		Close the open document if there is one.

The two 'Open' actions display the 'Edit' tab described in the Edit section of Tab navigation.


Results Menu

Open, create, close, and delete results databases.

Alt + r | o		Open an existing database.
Alt + r | n		Create and open a new database.
Alt + r | c		Close an open database.
Alt + r | d		Close and delete an open database.

All actions on the tabs available under the results menu after opening or creating a database are related to recording decisions about who played a set of games and telling interested parties, such as the ECF, the results of these games.

The tabs, with the keyboard actions to show them, are:

Alt + a		Administration
Alt + e		Events
Alt + n		NewPlayers
Alt + p		Players
Alt + f		ECF Codes
Alt + c		Club Codes
Alt + y		Player ECF Detail
Alt + v		ECF Events

The actions on each tab are listed in the tab's section under Tab navigation.

The Import Events action on the Administration tab processes files generated using the Export Events action on the Events tab.  It may ask that the identify program be used to resolve some player identities.


Tools Menu

Alt + t | u		Show dialogue where ECF default URLs can be edited.
Alt + t | f		Show dialogue where application fonts can be chosen.

Alt + h | e		Show EmailStore configuration file used by ChessResults.
Alt + h | x		Show description of results extraction configuration file.


Buttons

The buttons just below the menu bar emulate a tabbed notebook (for example like the preference editor in most browsers).  (This user interface was built before Tk8.5 became available making tabbed notebook a standard feature.)

The buttons at the bottom of a tab are the actions specific to the tab.  An action such as 'Close' appears on several tabs, but the thing being closed is different.


Popup menus

These appear by right-click when the pointer location makes a choice of actions relevant.

On the tabs controlled by the Results menu highlighting a line yellow is a sign that a popup menu is available.

On the tabs controlled by the Documents menu right-click scrolls one of the other panes in the tab to a relevant position if one can be determined.

On the windows created by the Sources menu items right-click usually scrolls one of the other panes in the window to a relevant position if one can be determined, but may ask for confirmation of an action instead.


Tab navigation

This document describes the tabs in ChessResultsECF.

These are:

	Administration
	Events
	NewPlayers
	Players
	Grading Codes
	Club Codes
	Player ECF Detail
	ECF Events

shown when a database is open

and:

	Edit

shown when a document is open

and other tabs shown to do actions requested from these tabs.

If a document and a database are open the Edit tab is shown.

ChessResultsLite does not have these tabs:

	Grading Codes
	Club Codes
	Player ECF Detail
	ECF Events

and ChessResultsOGD is obsolete following the change in availability and detail of ECF reference data on switching from grading to rating.

The only thing non-graders cannot do with ChessResultsECF is submit results and hence handle feedback.  This is because they do not have an account with the ECF to do results submissions for rating: when grading they would not have had some of the reference data needed either.

A number of tabs become available as subsidiaries of these tabs.
